# 2024MCM

2024.02.02 6:00am-02.06 9:00am, submission before 02.06 10:00am

Let's goooo

初步设想是每个人一个文件夹，然后设一个公共文件夹用来存最终结果，这样不容易搞混？

1. Papers must be submitted as PDF, in English, with a font of at least 12-point type. Papers must be within 25 page.Table of Contents count toward the page limit. Reference list (or Bibliography), notes pages, and any appendices now count toward the page limit and should be included after the solution pages.
2. required to submit PDF by email to solutions@comap.com
3. In the <u>subject line of your email</u> write your team's control number. For example, <u>Subject: 0000000 </u>. 
4. Use your team's control number as the name of your file attachment. For example: <u>0000000.pdf</u>. *Note: The attachment must be less than 20MB
5. Each page of the solution must contain the team control number and the page number at the <u>top of the page</u>. Use a page header on each page - for example: <u>Team # 2400000, Page 6 of 25 .</u>
6. MCM/ICM judges are primarily interested in the team's <u>thought processes, analysis of the problem, modeling approaches, and mathematical methods</u>.
7. Clearly <u>indicate the use of LLMs or other AI tools</u> in your report, including which model was used and for what purpose. Use inline citations and the reference section. ALSO append the Report on Use of AI after your 25-page solution. This new section will not be counted as part of the 25-page solution.

Overall:
• A Table of Contents assists the reader in previewing the organization of your report.
• Present a clarification or restatement of the problem as appropriate.
• Present a clear exposition of all variables and hypotheses.
• State and justify reasonable assumptions that bear on the problem.
• Present an analysis of the problem, motivating or justifying the model being used.
• Summarize derivations, computations, or illustrative examples in the main body of the solution, and leave lengthy derivations and/or calculations and data in appropriate appendices.
• Include a design of the model. Discuss how the model could be tested, to include error analysis, sensitivity, and/or stability.
• Discuss any apparent strengths or weaknesses to your model or approach.
• Provide a conclusion and report results explicitly.
• Document resources and references.
• <font color=Blue>Report on Use of AI</font>
