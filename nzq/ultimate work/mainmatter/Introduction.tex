\paragraph{Second Problem}

``momentum's role in the match'' means the level of momentum affects the future scores of the match.
The coach may subscribe to the idea that each point is an independent event and governed by probability.
In this view, consecutive success and momentum changes (swings) are seen as more random than influenced by previous events.
To judge this autocorrelation and to use our model, we 

\begin{itemize}
    \item perform autocorrelation test on momentum, and perform correlation test between current momentum and future scores.
\end{itemize}

    \item develop a model to
