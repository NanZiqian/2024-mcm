\section{Strength and Weaknesses}

\subsection{Strengths}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item {\bf Visualization in conclusion}: Visualization is used to interpret the result, making it intuitive and concise.
    \item {\bf Proper models chosen}: Two models in problem 1 and problem 3 have similar results of the influencing factors, which makes it more reliable.
    \item {\bf Stable performance}: Our model has stable prediction in different men's matches.
    \item {\bf Classification of different situations}: We evaluate momentum in two different situations, serve and opponent serve.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Weaknesses}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item {\bf Little subjective}: In problem 1, AHP is a subjective method to some extent, so although we get desired result similar to problem 3,
    some new completely objective method needs to be carried out.
    \item {\bf Limited ability in predicting other kinds of matches}: The technical indexes are different in other matches, so if we want to predict them, 
    we need to do some modification on our model.
\end{enumerate}
