\section{Swing Prediction Model}

\subsection{Model Overview}

\subsection{Visualization and Analysis}

calculate the match percentage of each match between the prediction model and the result from AHP.

\subsection{Weight of Factors}

If using match data of multiple different players, the factor with bigger weight is effective to 
all players.

\subsection{Advice against Opponent Based on Weight of Factors}

If using match data of a single player, the factor with bigger weight is extremely effective to 
this player.

Now we have finished Problem 3.

\subsection{Prediction Error with AHP model}

Overlap rate of the prediction model and the result from AHP is?

\paragraph{Factors we may fail to consider}

First of all, the AHP model is not considering all possible factors to momentum.
For example, the.
So the overlap rate's effectiveness is limited.

Then, the prediction model is only a classification model,
