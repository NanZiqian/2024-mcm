Query1:  \emph{
    “swings in play and runs of success by one player are random” 
can this sentence to be interpreted as  swings in play and runs of success by one player are independent?
}

Output: \emph{Yes, the sentence "swings in play and runs of success by one player are random" 
can be interpreted as suggesting that swings in play and runs of success by one player are 
independent of each other. In statistical terms, independence means that the occurrence or 
outcome of one event does not influence the occurrence or outcome of another.}

\emph{
In the context of tennis, this would imply that the fluctuations in the dynamics of the match 
(swings in play) and a player's success streaks (runs of success) are not connected or dependent 
on each other. Each event is considered random and not influenced by the occurrence of the other.
