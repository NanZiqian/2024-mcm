\begin{table}[!h]

\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
    
    \toprule
    Symbols & Description \\ 
    \midrule
    $player$ & the current player we are considering (e.g. while calculating momentum) \\
    $point_i$ & the $i^{th}$ point of the match, a vector consists of fields stated in the given dictionary \\
    $cur$ & the current index of the point, i.e. the match is currently at the $cur^{th}$ point \\
    $H_i$ & denotes the set $\{point_{cur}, point_{cur - 1}, \ldots , point_{cur - i + 1}\}$ \\
    $S_i$ & the set of latest $i$ points where $player$ serves\\
    $R_i$ & the set of latest $i$ points where $player$ returns\\
    $P_{ace}$ & current probability of hitting an ace by $player$ \\
    $P_{df}$ & current probability of double-faulting by $player$ \\
    $P_{1st}$ & current first serve goal rate by $player$ \\
    $P_{fw}$ & current probability of $player$ winning a served point within 3 rallies \\
    $rd$ & current return depth of $player$ \\
    $P_{win}$ & current probability of hitting a winner by $player$ \\
    $P_{net}$ & current net win rate of $player$ \\
    $dist$ & $player$'s running distance on the point \\
    $P_{unf}$ & current probability of hitting an unforced error by $player$ \\
    $scored$ & whether $player$ scored the current point \\
    $diff$ & the score diffrence for $player$ in the current game (by number of points) \\
    $M$ & the current momentum of $player$ after a point \\

To access a certain field in a point, we simply use the field name stated in the given dictionary as index, i.e. for a point $point$, we use $point_{ace}$ to denote the binary variable that shows whether $player$ hits an ace ball in the point.

\subsection{Assumptions}

To simplify the problem, we made the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Assumption 1:} The \verb|px_unf_err| column of the data only counts those unforced errors that occurred when the player was hitting in baseline.\\
    \textbf{Justification:} Usually when a player is at net, the point will end in a few strikes, and there's little probability that the player will hit an unforced error within that few strikes. What's more, the \verb|px_net_point| and \verb|px_net_point_won| columns of the data can predominantly reflect the player's ability at net, therefore reducing the impact of counting the unforced errors while at net.
    
    \item \textbf{Assumption 2:} The current performance on a certain aspect of a player can be reflected by the player's 3 latest shots of that aspect.\\
    E.g. $P_{ace}$ can be reflected by the proportion of aces in the 3 latest \textbf{serves} of the player, $P_{win}$ can be reflected by the proportion of winners in the 3 latest \textbf{shots} of the player, $rd$ can be reflected by the return depth of the 3 latest \textbf{returns} of the player, etc. \\
    \textbf{Justification:} The current performance of a player consists of the average performance and the status of the player at the moment, which can be comprehensively reflected in the player's performance on recent shots. For convenience, we specified that the 3 latest shots can reflect the player's current performance.
